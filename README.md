# QuickEasy Workout App
QuickEasy can be described as an Android application that assists those who are occupied in their daily lives to do an exercise of just 7 minutes to keep healthy and fit. When the user completes the 12 exercises, the results are stored locally in the database, which is accomplished through the use of room databases. It tracks the date and time at which the exercise is completed.
